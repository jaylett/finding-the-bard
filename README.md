# Finding the Bard

This was a short talk I gave at BarCamp London 1 in 2006 as an
introduction to using Xapian (from python).

Xapian has moved on considerably since then, and I haven't updated
the code, but it may still be of interest to some.

## Things you'll need

 * The Complete Works of Shakespeare as:
   * [Plain text from Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/100) as `shaks12.txt`
   * [XML from iBiblio](http://www.ibiblio.org/xml/examples/shakespeare/) in a directory `xml`
 * Eric Meyer's S5 to make the slideshow work (just the `ui/` directory will do)

## Contact

If you're interested in Xapian, then check out the [user guide](http://getting-started-with-xapian.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and then dive into more information on the [project website](http://xapian.org/) and [project wiki](https://trac.xapian.org/wiki).
